git and github

git is the version management software.  it is a separate program installed  on a person's local system (computer, usually).
 
github is a remote online git-based repository (one of several) managed by a private company. Using the service  where you can upload your git-managed code project into a github repo which will then be accessible to colleagues. Note that the version on github is not special.  The master is just the latest version of that particular branch.  
Later other branches may be merged back in and together the now-merged branch  will continue as the master branch.  
This allows more than one project member to be working on the code folders at the same time, then bring them back together later.  Note that good communication may keep team members from making edits that conflict with each other.
